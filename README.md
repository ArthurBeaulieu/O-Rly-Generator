Since I'm not a drawing artist, I took images from  [freepik](https://www.freepik.com/). Feel free to PR with more beasts to exhibit, but only if images are license free. Icons are taken from [flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/).

You can save your creations thanks to [html2canvas](https://html2canvas.hertzen.com/), which draw DOM elements into a canvas you can use. If you want to use the downloading feature on a local environment, you may run a web server (`npm install && npm run dev`), or disable CORS temporarlly on your web browser.

Tested on Firefox, Chrome and Edge browsers.
