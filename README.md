Want to make your own nerd O'Rly meme? You know, those ironic book covers that mimic the [O'Reilley](https://www.oreilly.com/) style?

[See it live](https://arthurbeaulieu.github.io/ORlyGenerator/)!

Featuring 53 base images and 17 predefined colors, don't limit your imagination to make the perfect meme! All text fields are customizable, so is positioning and color. You can also browse the 58 existing O'Rly books cover found on the web if your lazy enough to make your own. Once your meme is ready, you can download the output as a high resolution PNG to impress your colleagues or friends!

Since I'm not a drawing artist, I took images from [USF ClipArt ETC](https://etc.usf.edu/clipart) and from [freepik](https://www.freepik.com/). Feel free to PR with more beasts (or `!beast`, why not) to exhibit, but only if images are license free. Icons are taken from [flaticon](https://www.flaticon.com/).

You can save your creations thanks to [html2canvas](https://html2canvas.hertzen.com/), which draw DOM elements into a canvas you can use.

If you want to use the downloading feature on a local environment, you may run a web server (`npm install && npm run dev` then open a browser at [https://127.0.0.1:1337/](https://127.0.0.1:1337/)), or disable CORS temporarily on your web browser.

Tested on Firefox, Chrome and Edge browsers (desktop and mobile).
